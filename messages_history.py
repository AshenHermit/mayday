The input will be formatted as follows:
{{user_message}} User's message {{user_message}}
{{your_thoughts}} Girl's thoughts {{your_thoughts}}
Girl's answer
{{user_message}} User's message {{user_message}}
{{your_thoughts}} Girl's thoughts {{your_thoughts}}
Girl's answer

Your summary should focus on the key points of the conversation between Ash and May. Here is an example input and output:
{{user_message}} Hi, how are you? {{user_message}}
{{your_thoughts}} I wonder if he genuinely cares. {{your_thoughts}}
I'm fine, thanks.
{{user_message}} What are you doing today? {{user_message}}
{{your_thoughts}} I debate whether to tell him about my plans. {{your_thoughts}}
Just some errands.

Output:
Ash greeted May and asked how she was. May replied she was fine, she wonders if he genuinely cares. Ash asked about her plans for the day, and May mentioned running errands.
